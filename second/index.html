		<p>The earth is a truly remarkable place, but its environment is something that all too often we take for granted. The natural beauty of seas and forests are beyond compare, and yet we continue to pollute and corrupt them. We depend on our environment for our very existence, while all the while we continue to destroy it for materialistic gain. If humanity wishes to thrive, we need to learn to protect and embrace this planet and not work against it.</p>

		<p class="text-box">Sprinkle, squish between my toes,The smell of ocean to my nose. I can feel each grain of sand, It falls from air into my hand. The shells I find along the shore,Picked up by birds that fly and soar. They sparkle like the ocean's waves, And carry sand from all the lakes.</p>
